# ü¶ù Racoon

ü¶ù Racoon is a Python 3 tool for retrieving multiple files sequentally, as
specified in a manifest file. This is useful in data pipelines, CI/CD and generally
anywhere you need to gather multiple different files from various sources.

It can also:
 - copy local files
 - check the downloaded file checksum
 - check the downloaded zip file contents

# Installation
You can install Racoon using pip:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/archq-io/racoon
```

# Usage
Run the `racoon manifest.yaml` command or load a manifest directly from an URL
by running the `racoon https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../master/manifest.yaml`
command.

**Note:** `rget` is an alias of the `racoon` command.

# Racoon Manifest v1 file format specification

  files: [] # Same as "files" below, but guaranteed to run first

        file: # or load a checksum from a file
          url: https://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/current/amd64/iso-cd/SHA256SUMS # Multiple checksums not supported yet
  - url: https://example.com/gtfs/gtfs.zip
    destination: gtfs.zip
    verify:
      archive:
        contains:
          - agency.txt
          - calendar_dates.txt
          - fare_attributes.txt
          - routes.txt
          - stops.txt
          - stop_times.txt
          - trips.txt
after:
  files: [] # Same as "files" above, but guaranteed to run last
includes:
  - url: file:///home/user/manifest.yaml
  - url: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/.../master/manifest.yaml
```
**Note:** This file format specification can change at any time and should not
be considered stable.
